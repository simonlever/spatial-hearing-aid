# spatial-hearing-aid
Developing an open source, high quality low-latency binaural audio processor and frequency shaper with loud/low sound compression gates, to assist people with spatial hearing loss who have difficulty functioning socially in noisy environments. Also potentially useful to musicians and others who need a clearer sound image.

I have a good general techical and coding background, but no experience building hardware from the ground up. I am looking for interested collaborators who understand, or wish to understand the need I'm trying to fill. I have a working prototype of this hearing aid built with a stereo condenser mic and a DAW running on a mac laptop. I'm hoping to build a dedicated version with open source hardware.

I am currently considering harware options. Bela appears to be the best application of audio tools to hardware in an open source context. In Bela, the interface is controlled through C++
